FNO-Gravity: A Surrogate Model for Self-Gravitating Systems
This project explores the use of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to build a surrogate model for the evolution of a self-gravitating fluid under periodic boundary conditions. The work is directly inspired by the research in "Modeling Turbulent and Self-Gravitating Fluids with Fourier Neural Operators" (Poletti, Offner, et al., arXiv:2507.23662).

The primary goal was to validate the FNO's ability to learn complex, non-linear physical dynamics and test its stability in long-term, autoregressive predictions. A secondary goal was to investigate the model's performance when trained on incomplete data, mirroring a key challenge in real-world astrophysical observations.

Project Overview
The project was executed in three main phases:

Physics-Informed Data Generation: A simplified 3D gravity simulation was created using the Poisson equation in Fourier space. This served as the "ground truth" data generator, modeling how initial, smooth density fluctuations evolve over a single time step.

Surrogate Model Training: A powerful 3D FNO was trained to learn the mapping from an initial density field to its future state as dictated by the gravity simulation.

Validation & Advanced Testing: The trained model was rigorously tested through:

Single-Step Prediction: Evaluating accuracy on a test set.

Autoregressive Rollout: A long-term stability test where the model's output is fed back as its own input for 50 consecutive steps.

Incomplete Data Challenge: A final, advanced test where the model was trained on inputs with 50% of the data randomly removed to see if it could infer the missing information and predict the correct evolution.

Key Findings & Insights
This project yielded several key insights into the capabilities of FNOs for physics simulation:

1. High-Fidelity Learning of Single-Step Physics
The FNO demonstrated an exceptional ability to learn the one-step gravity transformation. The model achieved a near-zero Test Loss of 0.000003, indicating a near-perfect replication of the ground-truth physics for a single time step. The visual comparison below shows the FNO's output is virtually indistinguishable from the target.

2. Confirmed Long-Term Stability in Autoregressive Rollouts
This was the project's most significant success. When tasked with predicting 50 consecutive steps, the FNO remained stable and physically plausible. It successfully simulated the gravitational collapse of initial fluctuations into a well-defined, cosmic web-like structure without exploding or vanishing. This confirms that the model's tiny, per-step errors did not catastrophically accumulate, making it a robust tool for long-term simulation.

3. Realistic Performance on the Incomplete Data Challenge
When trained on data with 50% of the input pixels missing, the FNO still managed to learn the general evolution of the system.

A Harder Problem: The training process showed this task was significantly harder, as the model had to both infer the missing data and then predict its physical evolution.

Smoother, Averaged-Out Predictions: The model's output was smoother and less detailed than in the full-data experiment. This is an expected and realistic outcome, as the model produces a "best guess" based on partial information.

Alignment with Published Research: This outcome directly aligns with the paper's finding that prediction accuracy is "significantly degraded" when models are given incomplete information. My project independently validated this key research insight.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates that Fourier Neural Operators are a powerful and effective tool for building stable surrogate models of self-gravitating systems. The FNO architecture is not only capable of learning complex physical laws with high fidelity but can also maintain stability in long-term, autoregressive simulations.

Furthermore, the "incomplete data" experiment underscores both the potential and the challenges of applying these models to realistic observational data, confirming that while FNOs can infer missing information, it comes at the cost of prediction accuracy. This work serves as a strong foundation for further exploration into AI-driven scientific simulation.
