# FNO-Gravity: A Surrogate Model for Self-Gravitating Systems

This project explores the use of **Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)** to build a surrogate model for the evolution of a self-gravitating fluid under periodic boundary conditions. The work is directly inspired by the research in [_"Modeling Turbulent and Self-Gravitating Fluids with Fourier Neural Operators"_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23662) (Poletti, Offner, et al., arXiv:2507.23662).

The primary goal was to validate the FNO's ability to learn complex, non-linear physical dynamics and test its stability in long-term, autoregressive predictions. A secondary goal was to investigate the model's performance when trained on **incomplete data**, mirroring a key challenge in real-world astrophysical observations.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project was executed in three main phases:

### 1. Physics-Informed Data Generation
A simplified **3D gravity simulation** was created using the **Poisson equation in Fourier space**. This served as the *ground truth* data generator, modeling how initial, smooth density fluctuations evolve over a single time step.

### 2. Surrogate Model Training
A powerful **3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)** was trained to learn the mapping from an initial density field to its future state as dictated by the gravity simulation.

### 3. Validation & Advanced Testing

- **Single-Step Prediction:** Evaluating accuracy on a test set.
- **Autoregressive Rollout:** A long-term stability test where the model's output is fed back as its own input for 50 consecutive steps.
- **Incomplete Data Challenge:** A final, advanced test where the model was trained on inputs with 50% of the data randomly removed to see if it could infer the missing information and predict the correct evolution.

## üîç Key Findings & Insights

### ‚úÖ 1. High-Fidelity Learning of Single-Step Physics

The FNO demonstrated an exceptional ability to learn the one-step gravity transformation. The model achieved a **near-zero Test Loss of 0.000003**, indicating near-perfect replication of the ground-truth physics for a single time step.

The visual comparison shows that the FNO's output is virtually indistinguishable from the true simulation.

### üîÅ 2. Confirmed Long-Term Stability in Autoregressive Rollouts

This was the project's most significant success. When tasked with predicting **50 consecutive steps**, the FNO remained stable and physically plausible. It successfully simulated the gravitational collapse of initial fluctuations into a well-defined, **cosmic web-like structure** without exploding or vanishing.

This confirms that the model‚Äôs tiny per-step errors did **not catastrophically accumulate**, making it a robust tool for long-term simulation.

### üß© 3. Realistic Performance on the Incomplete Data Challenge

When trained on data with **50% of the input voxels missing**, the FNO still managed to learn the general evolution of the system.

- **A Harder Problem:** The training process showed this task was significantly more difficult, as the model had to both *infer the missing data* and *predict its physical evolution*.
- **Smoother Predictions:** The model's output was smoother and less detailed compared to the full-data experiment. This is an expected and realistic outcome, as the model produces a best guess from partial information.

#### Alignment with Research:
This outcome **directly validates** the research finding that prediction accuracy is *"significantly degraded"* when models are given incomplete information.

## üß† Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates that **Fourier Neural Operators** are a powerful and effective tool for building **stable surrogate models** of self-gravitating systems.

- FNOs can learn complex physical laws with high fidelity.
- They remain **stable** during long-term, autoregressive simulations.
- Even with incomplete data, FNOs can make *reasonable physical inferences*, although with some degradation in accuracy.

This work lays a strong foundation for future research into **AI-driven scientific simulation**, especially in astrophysics and cosmology.
